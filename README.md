## 🧭 Repository Setup & Branch Strategy

Branch purposes:
* main              → Stable, submission-ready code
* dev               → Integrates all feature branches
* feature/model     → ML / DL experiments
* feature/agent     → Agentic AI (LLM, LangChain flows)
* feature/frontend  → UI / UX implementation
* feature/backend   → APIs & database logic
* feature/data      → Data cleaning / preprocessing
* docs              → Documentation, reports, PPTs
* demo              → Demo assets (videos, screenshots)

Setup commands (run once when starting the repo):
```bash
# Initialize repo with main as default (Git 2.28+)
git init -b main

# Optional first commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Kurukshetra 2025 scaffold"

# Create branches from main
git branch dev
git branch feature/model
git branch feature/agent
git branch feature/frontend
git branch feature/backend
git branch feature/data
git branch docs
git branch demo

# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ORG/kurukshetra-2025.git

# Push all branches
git push -u origin main
git push origin dev feature/model feature/agent feature/frontend feature/backend feature/data docs demo
```

Workflow tip:
1. Develop on a feature/* branch.
2. Merge into dev after review.
3. Merge dev into main only for stable release checkpoints.
